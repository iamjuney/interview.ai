From video transcription to the response, it is just seamless. However, I could suggest the KKK - Kiss Kick Kiss method for the response part. Thats all, its been a nice experience having to beta-test this website"

Although I found few bugs/errors along the way, I'm still impressed on how the logic and the idea in developing such web application like this. There's still a large room for improvement such as user-friendliness and optimizing certain features for smoother user experience. But all in all, the application is great and has a lot of potential!"

Not only because of how difficult this project can be, but also because of its uniqueness. I am a student who has excellent written skills but lacks verbal skills as my nervousness gets the better of me. I was in an interview last year, but I didn’t make it because they were looking for a person who has good communication skills. However, I didn’t attend my scheduled interview as I was nervous. This project would surely help a lot of people like me who lack confidence and get nervous easily in such events. I am sure that this is a vital solution for enhancing verbal communication skills and boosting confidence during an interview.An 11/10 rating is too underrated and not enough.!"
